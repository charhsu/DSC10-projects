    "Welcome to the Final Project! Projects in DSC 10 are similar in format to homeworks, but are different in a few key ways. First, a project is comprehensive, meaning that it draws upon everything we've learned this quarter so far. Second, since problems can vary quite a bit in difficulty, some problems will be worth more points than others. Finally, in a project, the problems are more open-ended; they will usually ask for some result, but won't tell you what method should be used to get it. There might be several equally-valid approaches, and several steps might be necessary. This is closer to how data science is done in \"real life\".\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important that you **start early** on the project! It is the final assignment that is due this quarter, but it is due just a few days before the Final Exam. You are especially encouraged to **find a partner** to work through the project with. You can work with anyone from any section of the course, but you must follow the [Project Partner Guidelines](https://dsc10.com/project-partners/) on the course website. In particular, you are both required to actively contribute to all parts of the project, and you are not allowed to split up the problems and each work on certain problems. If working in a pair, you should submit one notebook to Gradescope for the both of you. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Important:** The `otter` tests don't usually tell you that your answer is correct. More often, they help catch basic mistakes. It's up to you to ensure that your answer is correct. If you're not sure, ask someone (not for the answer, but for some guidance about your approach). Directly sharing answers between groups is not okay, but discussing problems with the course staff or with other students is encouraged.\n",

    "Please do not import any additional packages - you don't need them, and our autograder may not be able to run your code if you do.\n",

    "## About the Show 📺\n",
    "\n",
    "The Great British Bake Off (known in the US as the Great British Baking Show) is a competition-style reality television show where amateur bakers participate in themed baking challenges. Each week's episode revolves around a theme; past themes include Bread Week, Cake Week, Vegan Week, and Italian Week. In each episode, the bakers are given three timed challenges based on the week's theme: the Signature Challenge, the Technical Challenge, and the Showstopper Challenge. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the Signature Challenge, the judges broadly specify what the bakers should make, and the bakers have freedom to use flavors, techniques, and recipes as they wish. The Signature Challenge earns its name because it's an opportunity for bakers to express themselves and their unique baking style to both the judges and the viewers at home. Many of the Signature Challenge bakes come from tried-and-tested recipes that contestants like to bake for their friends and families. For example, during Festivals Week in Season 10, the bakers were tasked with creating 24 buns themed around a world festival or holiday. Contestant Henry Bird made [these Chocolate Kardemummabullar](https://thegreatbritishbakeoff.co.uk/recipes/all/henry-chocolate-kardemummabullar/).\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/signature_bake.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\">\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Technical Challenge, bakers have no idea what they will be asked to create until the timer for the challenge starts. This means they can't prepare for it, and they have to rely on their baking knowledge and intuition. The Technical Challenge earns its name because it tests the bakers' technical knowledge of baking as a discipline.  Each Technical Challenge is posed by one particular judge, using a recipe from the judge's own personal collection. Bakers are provided with ingredients and a recipe, which is usually extremely basic, sometimes lacking ingredient measurements or containing single steps like \"make a shortcrust pastry\" with no further explanation. The finished products are judged blind and ranked from worst to best. An example of a Technical Challenge includes [judge Paul Hollywood's Baklava](https://thegreatbritishbakeoff.co.uk/recipes/all/paul-hollywood-baklava/). \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/baklava.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\">\n",
    "\n",
    "The third challenge, the Showstopper, is similar to the Signature Challenge, in that bakers are given requirements ahead of time and have freedom to create their own recipes and prepare ahead of time. The main difference is that the Showstoppers are more challenging and larger-scale. The judges are looking for bakes that are breathtaking in both their appearance and their taste. For example, during Bread Week in Season 6, the bakers were asked to create a 3-D bread sculpture. Contestant Paul Jagger impressed the judges and millions of viewers with his *King of the Jungle* lion sculpture.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/lion_bread_sculpture.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Each episode of the show features all three challenges. The contestants' bakes are tasted and assessed by two judges, and at the end of each episode, the hosts announce who will be eliminated from the competition and who will be recognized with a special award of \"Star Baker\" ⭐ (introduced in Season 2). Typically, one contestant is eliminated and one is crowned Star Baker ⭐, but on occasion there have been special cases in which zero or multiple people were eliminated or awarded Star Baker ⭐. \n",
    "\n",
    "The final episode of each season is held when there are just three bakers remaining. All three bakers compete in the final, and at the end, one winner is chosen and each of the others is considered a \"runner-up\". \n",
    "\n",
    "If you'd like to see the show for yourself, several seasons are available on [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/title/80063224). 🎥"

    "## About the Data 💾\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, we'll be using a few different datasets, which we've loaded in and saved in DataFrames called\n",
    "- `baker_weeks`, \n",
    "- `challenge_results`,  \n",
    "- `technical_challenge_recipes`, and\n",
    "- `bakers`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that while the Great British Bake Off has filmed fourteen seasons, our datasets do not include the most recent seasons. Since our datasets come from different [sources](#sources) and were compiled at different times, some of these datasets include more seasons than others. In addition, the number of bakers each season has varied, but all seasons have filmed one episode per week.\n",
    " \n",
    "The `baker_weeks` DataFrame includes a breakdown of each baker's performance each week (that is, each episode), for the first eleven seasons of the show. Each row represents information **for one baker for one week**. This means that each baker will appear in the DataFrame multiple times. Bakers will continue to appear in the DataFrame even in weeks after they got eliminated, so these rows will have missing values (`NaN`).  \n",
    "  \n",
    "The `'Week Name'` column contains the theme of that week's episode. We also have the baker's name, gender (`'M'` and `'F'` are the only options), and age, the season number (also called the series number in other DataFrames), and the week number within that season. There are columns that indicate whether each baker was a Star Baker ⭐ that week, was eliminated that week, competed that week, or went on to win the season's competition 🥇. A few columns require more explanation about the show:\n",
    "- `'Judge'` is either `'Mary'` or `'Prue'`. For the first seven seasons, the show's two judges were [Paul Hollywood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Hollywood) and [Mary Berry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Berry). After that, the show switched networks and Mary Berry was replaced by [Prue Leith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prue_Leith). Since Paul Hollywood was a judge every season, the `'Judge'` column contains the name of the other judge.\n",
    "- `'technical_rank'` contains a number reflecting each baker's ranking in the Technical Challenge (with 1 meaning 1st place, 2 meaning 2nd place, etc.)\n",
    "-  `'Signature Handshake'` and `'Showstopper Handshake'` contain information on whether the contestant received a handshake \t🤝 from judge Paul Hollywood as he tasted their bake. Paul has a reputation for giving praise sparingly, and his so-called \"[Hollywood Handshakes 🤝](https://hollywoodhandshakes.com/)\" are considered a great honor. \n",

    "In the `'Technical Rank'` column, contestants are given a ranking for how well they performed in the Technical Challenge, with 1 being the best. Notice in the first ten rows of `competed` shown above, some of the middle rankings are missing. In this episode, the judges didn't reveal everyone's rank and instead just pointed out the top three and bottom three contestants. For reasons like this, our dataset has just a few missing values, which we will ignore for this section. \n",

    "If we want to get a sense of how skilled a baker is, the technical rank is helpful, but needs to be taken in the context of the number of contestants still in the competition. For example, ranking 3rd place in the first week when there are many contestants is a lot more impressive than ranking 3rd place in the final week, when there are just three bakers remaining. To address this problem, we'll convert these rankings into *percentiles* to measure skill relative to the number of contestants remaining. \n",

    "**Question 4.1.** Create a DataFrame called `perc` with the same data as `competed`, plus a new column called `'Contestants'`  that contains the number of contestants that competed each week. For example, since the first ten rows of `competed` all correspond to the first week of the first season, in which there were 10 bakers, the first ten entries of the `'Contestants'` column should be 10.  \n",

    "So there is definitely a difference in mean difficulty scores between Mary's and Paul's Technical Challenge recipes, within our sample of recipes that have appeared as Technical Challenges in the show. But does this reflect a difference in mean recipe difficulty scores in the population (the judges' recipe collections), or was it by chance that our sample's difficulty displayed this difference? Let's do a hypothesis test to find out. We'll state our hypotheses as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Null Hypothesis:** The mean difficulty of Mary's recipe collection equals the mean difficulty of Paul's recipe collection. Equivalently, the difference in the mean difficulty for Mary's and Paul's recipes equals 0.\n",
    "- **Alternative Hypothesis:** The mean difficulty of Mary's recipe collection does not equal the mean difficulty of Paul's recipe collection. Equivalently, the difference in the mean difficulty for Mary's and Paul's recipe does not equal 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we were able to set up our hypothesis test as a question of whether our population parameter – the difference in mean difficulty scores for Mary's and Paul's recipe collections – is equal to a certain value, we can **test our hypotheses by constructing a confidence interval for the parameter**. This is the method we used in Lecture 21 to test whether the mean human body temperature was actually 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. For a refresher on this method, you can read more about conducting a hypothesis test with a confidence interval in [CIT 13.4](https://inferentialthinking.com/chapters/13/4/Using_Confidence_Intervals.html#)."

    "We have now uncovered some interesting facts about the difficulty levels of the different judges' recipe collections. However, we also want to know whether the judges' recipe collections have other differences. For example, do certain judges have recipes with more ingredients, more components, or longer instructions?\n",

Feel free to celebrate by whipping up some baked goods, like these cute [baby panda madeleines](https://www.instagram.com/p/CBDzDwsHSBW/?utm_source=ig_embed&utm_campaign=embed_video) created by Kim-Joy, a contestant from Season 9 of the Great British Bake Off.\n",

    "1. Select `Kernel -> Restart & Run All` to ensure that you have executed all cells, including the test cells. <p style=\"color: red\"><b>⚠️ Important!</b> We will allot 20 minutes of computer time to run your notebook. If your notebook takes longer than this to run, it may not pass the autograder! Select \"Kernel -> Restart and Run All\" to time how long your notebook takes. A notebook with correct answers should take less than 10 minutes.</p>\n",

    "2. Read through the notebook to make sure everything is fine and all tests passed.\n",
    "3. Run the cell below to run all tests, and make sure that they all pass.\n",
    "4. Download your notebook using File -> Download as -> Notebook (.ipynb), then upload your notebook to Gradescope. Don't forget to add your partner to your group on Gradescope!\n",
    "5. Stick around while the Gradescope autograder grades your work. Make sure you see that all tests have passed on Gradescope.\n",
    "6. Check that you have a confirmation email from Gradescope and save it as proof of your submission. \n",
    "\n",
    "If running all the tests at once causes a test to fail that didn't fail when you ran the notebook in order, check to see if you changed a variable's value later in your code. Make sure to use new variable names instead of reusing ones that are used in the tests. \n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, the tests here and on Gradescope just check the format of your answers. We will run correctness tests after the assignment's due date has passed."
